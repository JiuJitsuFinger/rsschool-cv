## About Me

_I am 32 y.o. I am from Belarus. After the political events, I lost my job because I protested. I started learning JS quite recently, but I have high hopes for it, because I want to change my life._

_Now I spend my free time studying JS. I work as a DJ on the weekends. But now, even in cafes, I take my laptop with me._

> Chris Hughes once said:
> "The more experienced the programmer, the more he realizes the scarcity of his knowledge and skills."

_And I really want to reach the level where I realize how little I know, because now I know absolutely nothing._

_Among my strengths, I can note practicality, loyalty and meticulousness. I usually don't do work just to get it done. I try to always do it right._

**_My hobbies:_**

1. **Basketball**
2. **Dance**
3. **Music**
